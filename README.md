# 🛡️ Extractor: Credential Awareness Simulation

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project is intended for **educational and awareness purposes only**. It demonstrates how phishing techniques work to raise cybersecurity awareness. No actual user credentials were collected or misused. Always conduct ethical simulations in controlled environments with informed consent.

---

## 🔍 Overview

**Extractor** is a web-based simulation tool designed to showcase the mechanics behind credential phishing attacks. This includes:

- ⚠️ Cloning familiar login page interfaces  
- 🎯 Using bait content to simulate social engineering  
- 📋 Logging credentials via Google Sheets API integration

Users are lured with "Python Cheat Sheets" and prompted to enter credentials on a cloned login interface. Submitted data is captured and stored in a Google Spreadsheet using custom JavaScript.

## 🧠 Purpose & Educational Value

Phishing is one of the most common attack vectors in modern cybersecurity breaches. This simulation helps illustrate:

- 🧠 Social engineering principles  
- 🎨 Visual trust and frontend mimicry  
- 🧮 JavaScript-based data capture  
- 🛡️ Importance of credential hygiene and vigilance
